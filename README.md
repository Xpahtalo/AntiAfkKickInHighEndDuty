# AntiAfkKick

While I can understand NightmareXIV's reasoning, I disagree, especially when the logout timer in the overworld is not active. Kicking inactive players from instances is common in practice in almost all games for good reason. However, for anything under the High-End duty tab, there is no expectation that you can replace a dropped player while in the duty. For fights with checkpoints where you are going in with set players, AFK kick does not make any sense and I am fine with using it then. 

## Install
Add `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xpahtalo/plugins/master/pluginmaster.json` to your 3rd party repo list.

## How it works?
It just sends left control key to the game every now and then. Seems like for now it's enough to make game think user is still active. It won't send keypress if you are actually playing.
